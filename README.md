## Hello, I'm smansu4!

This account mainly a safe space for me to experiment, learn new/improve existing skills, and most importantly have fun. 

I believe the only way to get better at a craft is to practice and work on projects that interest you. That is what you will see here -- random projects that came to mind and seemed cool/fun enough to me to want to create them. This account isn't meant to be a professional portfolio, but a space to showcase (mainly to myself) my journey as an engineer. 

I hope something here interests you and inspires you to create something yourself!
